# SnapchatProj

## Description
This was made simple and fast with the help of my partner for this course. A project for CS 390; Machine Perception that uses python and OpenCV to make Snapchat-like filters in an easy to use and understand GUI with tkinter.

## Installation
Use anaconda navigator with python. Make sure to include all of the imported packages: Dlib (which includes CMake), Tkinter, and OpenCV. Dlib and Tkinter source code also found on Github. Also, make sure that you have the .dat file titled "shape_predictior_68_face_landmarks" onto your desktop; this is also found along with Dlib.

```bash
pip install CMake
```
```bash
pip install Dlib
```
## Usage
Create a folder with the title "Snapchat" on your desktop to be able to save pictures created with this project. Add everything in the Snapchat folder provided to your desktop to also get the animal filters to work. Must have a camera attached to the machine that will be running the project.
